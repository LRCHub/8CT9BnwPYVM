[00:15.08] I found the note she left me
[00:18.04] And once again I just couldn't care
[00:21.99] A black and white movie at the end
[00:24.73] Where have I seen this all before
[00:41.23] 
[00:28.48] Convinced I really loved her
[00:32.12] She believed the act, it was so unfair
[00:35.46] I stumbled through the final scene
[00:38.95] She won't believe it anymore
[00:52.95] 
[00:42.86] In my dreams you never left
[00:45.82] But in the mornin' there I'd be
[00:49.55] Alone with some new true believer
[00:53.33] Lyin' next to me
[01:01.33] 
[00:58.22] Got to get back to you
[01:01.94] God give me the power
[01:05.50] Back to you
[01:09.00] Each moment's like an hour
[01:12.61] If only I could find the way
[01:15.92] I'd find my way back to you
[01:29.42] 
[01:33.93] The saddest sound I ever heard
[01:37.49] Was the door that closed behind you
[01:41.08] Blind to what was in my heart
[01:44.17] I must admit I was a fool
[01:56.67] 
[01:48.05] Well, I'm older now and wiser
[01:51.10] The truth is easier to see
[01:54.83] The boy you knew was searchin'
[01:58.64] But now the man knows what he needs
[02:16.14] 
[02:03.56] Back to you
[02:07.59] Can't live my life as one
[02:11.99] Back to you
[02:14.20] When all is said and done
[02:17.79] If only I could find the way
[02:21.56] I'd find my way back to you
[02:35.06] 
[02:42.25] Got to get back to you
[02:46.49] God give me the power
[02:50.10] Back to you
[02:53.44] Each moment's like an hour
[02:57.20] If only I could find the way
[03:00.57] I'd find my way
[03:08.07] 
[03:02.99] Back to you
[03:07.17] Can't live my life as one
[03:11.40] Back to you
[03:14.64] When all is said and done
[03:17.71] If only I could find the way
[03:21.31] I'd find my way
[03:28.81] 
[03:25.29] Back to you
[03:32.62] Back to you
